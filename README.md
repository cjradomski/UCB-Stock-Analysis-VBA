# Stock Analysis Using VBA
In this analysis, VBA was used to automate tasks in an Excel spreadsheet to determine the performance of certain green energy stocks for the years 2017 and 2018.
Macros/subroutines were created to find the volume and yearly returns for each of the stocks that were included in the dataset. 

green_stocks.xlsm contains the datasets and the VBa code for the macros that were created. "2017 All Stocks.pdf" and "2018 All Stocks.pdf" show the results of the analysis.
